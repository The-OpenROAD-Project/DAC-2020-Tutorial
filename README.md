## Getting Help

If you have any questions before, during or after the tutorial, feel free to email [ahosny@openroad.tools](mailto:ahosny@openroad.tools)

## Prepare Your Environment

During the tutorial, we will be covering how to get started with OpenROAD. However, thatâ€™s not all. We will be presenting how to develop tools using OpenROAD infrastructure, and how to contribute to its master codebase. For full participation in the tutorial, we ask you to prepare your machine as detailed below.

### Supported Platforms
* CentOS 7: https://www.centos.org/download/
* Ubuntu 18: https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/
* Windows 10 using WSL: https://ubuntu.com/wsl

If you are not using any of the two platforms, we suggest that you download VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/) and install a supported platform. Alternatively, you can install Docker (https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and pull an official image.

### Prerequisites
OpenROAD tools only need `Tcl` to be installed.
* CentOS: `sudo yum install tcl`
* Ubuntu: `sudo apt install tcl`

To use the full automation features of OpenROAD flow, you need to install:
* `Python 3`
    * CentOS: `sudo yum install python3`
    * Ubuntu: `sudo yum install python3`
* Time
    * CentOS: `sudo yum install time`
    * Ubuntu: `sudo yum install time`
* KLayout
Follow instructions here: https://www.klayout.de/build.html

### Download OpenROAD Tools
Download pre-built tools from: https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/releases
After you download, extract the downloaded file and add it to the PATH environment variable using: `export PATH=</path/to/openroad/bin>:</path/to/openroad>:$PATH`

### Test OpenROAD Tools
From the terminal screen, type in:
```shell
$ openroad
| OpenROAD 0.9.0 bfb1291039
| This program is licensed under the BSD-3 license. See the LICENSE file for details. 
| Components of the program may be licensed under more restrictive licenses which must be
| honored.
%
```

If you see the above OpenROAD message, that means tools are working properly.

### Development Dependencies
If you are planning to dive into OpenROAD data models using C++, you will need to install development dependencies to be able to build the tool from sources.

Development dependencies are documented in this Dockerfile: https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD/blob/master/Dockerfile

## OpenROAD Cloud

You can run OpenROAD flow without installing the tools locally by using OpenROAD public cloud service.

OpenROAD Cloud is available at https://cloud.theopenroadproject.org/

At the time of the tutorial, the platform offers OpenROAD flow on Nangate45. Support for Skywater PDK is in progress.
